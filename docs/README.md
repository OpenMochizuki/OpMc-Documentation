# Introduction

Welcome to the OpenMochi documentation site! Everything you see here is a work in progress, as the game is still in heavy development. Everything is subject to change.

This has been modified from [OpenTaiko](https://opentaiko.github.io/OpTk-Documentation/)'s documentation pages, so please do visit them if you want a different Taiko experience with lots of built-in songs and other fun features.
